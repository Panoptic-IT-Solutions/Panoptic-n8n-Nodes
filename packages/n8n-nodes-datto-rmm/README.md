```

#### Filter Parameters
Many operations support filtering:
```
Site Name: "Production" (partial match allowed)
Hostname: "web-server" (partial match allowed)  
Device Type: "Workstation"
Operating System: "Windows"
```

#### Resource Mapper
All operations support dynamic field selection:
- Use "Fields to Return" to choose specific data

```json
{
  "json": {
    // Datto RMM API response data
  },
  "pairedItem": {
    "item": 0
  }
}
```

## üîç Advanced Usage

### Using Resource Mapper

The Resource Mapper allows dynamic field selection:

1. **Enable Resource Mapper**
   - Available on all operations
   - Located in "Fields to Return" section

2. **Configure Fields**
   - Select specific fields to include
   - Improves performance
   - Reduces data transfer

3. **Example Configuration**
   ```
   Fields to Return:
   ‚úì ID
   ‚úì Name  
   ‚úì Status
   ‚úó Description (unchecked to exclude)
   ```

### Batch Processing

For large datasets, use batch processing:

1. **Split In Batches Node**
   - Process 10-50 items at a time
   - Prevents API rate limiting
   - Improves reliability

2. **Configuration Example**
   ```
   Batch Size: 25
   Options: Keep Input Data
   ```

### Custom Variables

   ```

3. **Use in Automation**
   - Reference variables in job parameters
   - Dynamic configuration based on site/account settings

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Errors (401)
```
Error: Request failed with status code 401
```
**Solutions:**
1. Verify API credentials in n8n
2. Check API URL format (include https://)
3. Ensure API keys have proper permissions
4. Test credentials using "Test" button

#### Rate Limiting (429)
```
Error: Request failed with status code 429
```
**Solutions:**
1. Reduce batch sizes
2. Add delays between operations
3. Use pagination for large datasets
4. Check account API limits

#### Device Not Found (404)
```
Error: Device was not found
```
**Solutions:**
1. Verify device UID/ID/MAC address
2. Check device exists in Datto RMM
3. Ensure proper permissions for device access

#### Site Access Issues (403)
```
Error: Authenticated user doesn't have access to this resource
```
**Solutions:**
1. Verify site UID is correct
2. Check user permissions in Datto RMM
3. Ensure API credentials have site access

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for troubleshooting:

1. **Environment Variable**
   ```bash
   N8N_LOG_LEVEL=debug
   ```

2. **Check Logs**
   - Review n8n logs for detailed API calls
   - Examine request/response data
   - Identify specific error points

### Best Practices

#### Performance Optimization
1. **Use Resource Mapper** - Select only needed fields
2. **Implement Pagination** - For large datasets
3. **Batch Processing** - Group operations efficiently
4. **Cache Results** - Store frequently accessed data

#### Error Handling
1. **Enable Continue on Fail** - For bulk operations
2. **Add Error Workflows** - Handle failures gracefully  
3. **Implement Retries** - For transient network issues
4. **Log Errors** - Track failures for debugging

#### Security
1. **Secure Credentials** - Use n8n credential system
2. **Limit API Scope** - Create dedicated API keys
3. **Regular Rotation** - Update API keys periodically
4. **Monitor Usage** - Track API consumption
