# n8n-nodes-datto-rmm

## 0.4.12

### Patch Changes

- 3161421: CRITICAL: Fix pagination consistency across all Datto RMM resources
  - Fixed all resource operations to use consistent 0-based pagination (page=0) instead of mixed 1-based pagination
  - Resolves critical issue where some operations would return empty results despite API returning totalCount > 0
  - Ensures uniform pagination behavior across Account, Device, Site, and Alert resources
  - Affects all manual pagination operations: getDevices, getSites, getUsers, getVariables, getComponents, getOpenAlerts, getResolvedAlerts, getDeviceDetails, getDeviceAuditData, getSiteDevices, getSiteVariables
  - Fixed Content-Type header issue that was incorrectly set for GET requests
  - All resources now work consistently with both automatic pagination (retrieveAll: true) and manual pagination (page: 0, max: N)

  This resolves the core pagination inconsistency that prevented reliable data retrieval across different resource types.

## 0.4.11

### Patch Changes

- dbb1902: Add automatic pagination support for all "get all" operations
  - Added "Retrieve All" toggle option for all paginated operations in account and site resources
  - When enabled (default), automatically fetches all results across all pages without user configuration
  - When disabled, allows manual pagination control with page and max results parameters
  - Improved user experience by eliminating the need to manually handle pagination for large result sets
  - Enhanced pagination helper with proper Datto RMM API response structure handling
  - Affects all list operations: getDevices, getUsers, getSites, getVariables, getComponents, getOpenAlerts, getResolvedAlerts across account and site resources

- 3e4795e: CRITICAL: Fix pagination indexing across all account operations
  - Fixed pagination to use 1-based indexing (page=1) instead of 0-based (page=0) for all account operations to match API requirements
  - Resolves issue where operations would return empty results despite totalCount > 0
  - Ensures consistency with site operations that were already working correctly
  - Affects getDevices, getSites, getUsers, getVariables, and all other account operations

## 0.4.10

### Patch Changes

- d9ede9d: **Fix: Pagination and Response Parsing for Account Operations**

  Fixed critical pagination and response parsing issues that prevented proper data extraction from Datto RMM API responses.

  ## üêõ Fixed Issues
  - **Empty Results**: Operations like "Get Sites" returned empty arrays despite API showing totalCount > 0
  - **Wrong Page Index**: Node was using 1-based pagination while Datto RMM API expects 0-based pagination
  - **Response Structure**: Node was returning entire response wrapper instead of extracting data arrays

  ## ‚úÖ Resolved
  - ‚úÖ **0-Based Pagination**: Changed all page defaults from 1 to 0 to match Datto RMM API expectations
  - ‚úÖ **Data Extraction**: Added operation-specific response parsing:
    - `getSites` ‚Üí extracts `sites[]` array
    - `getDevices` ‚Üí extracts `devices[]` array
    - `getUsers` ‚Üí extracts `users[]` array
    - `getComponents` ‚Üí extracts `components[]` array
    - `getOpenAlerts`/`getResolvedAlerts` ‚Üí extracts `alerts[]` array
  - ‚úÖ **Pagination Info**: Includes helpful pagination details when no data found

  ## üéØ Impact

  This resolves the core usability issue where users saw response metadata instead of actual data. Account operations now return clean, individual data objects that can be properly processed in n8n workflows.

  **Before**: `{ pageDetails: {...}, sites: [] }` (wrapper object)
  **After**: Individual site objects that can be mapped, filtered, and processed

  **Affected Operations:** All account list operations (getSites, getDevices, getUsers, etc.)

## 0.4.9

### Patch Changes

- 8501dc8: **Bug Fixes: API Endpoint 404 Errors Resolved**

  Fixed critical API endpoint issues that were causing 404 errors across multiple Datto RMM operations:

  ## üêõ Fixed Issues
  - **Account Operations**: All account operations (getSites, getDevices, getUsers, etc.) were failing with 404 errors
  - **Alert Operations**: All alert operations (get, resolve, mute, unmute) were returning 404 responses
  - **Missing API Prefix**: Endpoints were missing the required `/api/v2` prefix that the Datto RMM API requires

  ## ‚úÖ Resolved
  - ‚úÖ Account endpoints: Added `/api/v2` prefix to all operations (`/account/*` ‚Üí `/api/v2/account/*`)
  - ‚úÖ Alert endpoints: Added `/api/v2` prefix to all operations (`/alert/*` ‚Üí `/api/v2/alert/*`)
  - ‚úÖ ResourceMapper consistency: Standardized field naming across all resources
  - ‚úÖ All tests passing: Verified functionality with comprehensive test suite

  ## üéØ Impact

  This fix resolves the primary issue preventing users from successfully using account and alert operations. The "Get account sites" operation and all other account/alert operations now work correctly.

  **Affected Operations:**
  - Account: `get`, `getSites`, `getDevices`, `getUsers`, `getComponents`, `getOpenAlerts`, `getResolvedAlerts`
  - Alert: `get`, `resolve`, `mute`, `unmute`
