		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Refactor Main Node Architecture with Modular Resource Routing",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the refactoring of the main node architecture into subtasks such as: (1) Analyze current node implementation, (2) Design modular architecture and resource router, (3) Implement ResourceRouter class, (4) Refactor execute() method for delegation, (5) Integrate error boundaries and logging, (6) Update type usage and enable strict mode, (7) Write unit and integration tests.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves architectural transformation, modularization, routing logic, error handling, and adherence to strict TypeScript and n8n best practices. It requires deep understanding of the existing codebase and careful planning to avoid regressions. High cyclomatic and cognitive complexity are expected due to multiple resource types and delegation logic[1][3]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core HTTP Client and Error Handling Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into: (1) Design HTTPClient class structure, (2) Implement retry logic and rate limiting, (3) Add request/response interceptors and logging, (4) Integrate authentication flows (OAuth 2.0, API key), (5) Implement response validation and error handling, (6) Develop and run comprehensive tests.",
			"reasoning": "Building a robust HTTP client with advanced features (retry, rate limiting, interceptors, multiple auth flows) and consistent error handling introduces significant complexity, especially with the need for type safety and integration with the rest of the system[1][3]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Account Resource with Complete Operation Support",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Define all Account operations and interfaces, (2) Implement AccountResource class methods, (3) Add parameter validation, (4) Handle pagination and filtering, (5) Integrate with routing and HTTP client, (6) Write unit and integration tests.",
			"reasoning": "Expanding a resource from a single operation to eight, with type safety, validation, and pagination, increases both cyclomatic and maintainability complexity, but is more contained than architectural or infrastructure tasks[1][3]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Device Resource Operations",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Define Device operations and types, (2) Implement DeviceResource class and methods, (3) Add advanced filtering/search, (4) Implement bulk and custom field operations, (5) Add device grouping and health checks, (6) Integrate with main architecture, (7) Develop comprehensive tests.",
			"reasoning": "Device resource is critical and complex, with many operations, advanced filtering, bulk actions, and custom fields. This increases both cyclomatic and cognitive complexity, requiring careful modularization and testing[1][3]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create Site Resource Management System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Define Site operations and types, (2) Implement SiteResource class and CRUD, (3) Add hierarchy and relationship management, (4) Implement configuration and variable support, (5) Add health monitoring and reporting, (6) Write tests for all features.",
			"reasoning": "Site management involves multiple operations, hierarchy, and relationships, but is less complex than device resource due to fewer advanced features. Still, it requires careful design for maintainability and testability[1][3]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Alert Resource with Advanced Filtering",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Define Alert operations and types, (2) Implement AlertResource class and methods, (3) Add advanced filtering and bulk operations, (4) Implement escalation and notification management, (5) Add analytics and reporting, (6) Develop and run tests.",
			"reasoning": "Alert resource requires advanced filtering, escalation, and analytics, increasing complexity, but the number of operations is moderate. The need for performance and auditability adds to the challenge[1][3]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Resource Mapping and Dynamic Field Selection",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Design ResourceMapper utility, (2) Implement dynamic field selection logic, (3) Add field validation and transformation, (4) Map n8n parameters to API fields, (5) Support nested and array mapping, (6) Implement conditional field display, (7) Write mapping tests.",
			"reasoning": "Dynamic field mapping and selection across resources introduces high cognitive and cyclomatic complexity, especially with nested structures and conditional logic. This utility is foundational for flexible parameter handling[1][3]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Create Job Resource with Result Handling",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Define Job operations and types, (2) Implement JobResource class and methods, (3) Add job scheduling and monitoring, (4) Implement result parsing and formatting, (5) Add queue management and timeout handling, (6) Write tests for all job features.",
			"reasoning": "Job resource involves execution, monitoring, result handling, and queue management, which are moderately complex but well-scoped compared to architectural or mapping tasks[1][3]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Audit Resource Operations",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Define Audit operations and types, (2) Implement AuditResource class and methods, (3) Add compliance reporting and export, (4) Implement filtering, retention, and alerting, (5) Write tests for audit features.",
			"reasoning": "Audit resource is important for compliance but has fewer operations and less dynamic logic than other resources, resulting in lower complexity[1][3]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Develop System Resource and Filter Management",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Implement SystemResource class and operations, (2) Build FilterResource class and methods, (3) Add rate limit and performance monitoring, (4) Implement custom filter builder and templates, (5) Write tests for system and filter features.",
			"reasoning": "System and filter resources are foundational but have fewer operations and less business logic, keeping complexity moderate[1][3]."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Load Options and Dynamic Dropdown Population",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Implement LoadOptionsService class, (2) Add caching and fallback logic, (3) Implement dependent and searchable dropdowns, (4) Write tests for dropdown population and caching.",
			"reasoning": "Dynamic dropdowns and caching are important for UX but are less complex than core resource or architectural tasks, with most complexity in handling dependencies and large datasets[1][3]."

		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Comprehensive Error Handling Enhancement and Production Optimization",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Enhance error handling and messaging, (2) Implement request/response caching, (3) Add comprehensive logging and monitoring, (4) Optimize performance and input validation, (5) Create documentation and help text, (6) Add health check endpoints and graceful degradation.",
			"reasoning": "Production optimization and error handling span the entire codebase, requiring coordination, consistency, and robust testing, which increases complexity despite being enhancements[1][3]."
